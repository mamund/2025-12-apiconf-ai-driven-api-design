AI-Driven API Design: Building with AI as Your Coach

AI isn’t the new engineer — it’s the new collaborator.

My O’Reilly Live Course, [AI-Driven API Design](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/ai-driven-api-design/0642572169893/), returns November 11, 2025. The last few times we ran this course, it filled up fast (the most recent one sold out).

Every session confirms the same truth: people don’t want more automation, they want better collaboration.

In this three-hour, hands-on workshop, you’ll work directly with the same AI coaches I use when designing APIs.
These small, focused assistants help you:

* Capture early requirements and write API Stories
* Generate ALPS descriptions, OpenAPI specs, and mock services
* Create documentation, tests, and security profiles
  All in conversation with AI partners that help you think, revise, and refine — not just generate.

You’ll walk away with both skills and tools: practical experience designing APIs with AI and your own working coaches to keep experimenting with afterward.

AI can draft the scaffolding, but the architecture still belongs to you.

AI isn’t here to replace us — it’s here to coach us.

My O’Reilly Live Course AI-Driven API Design returns Nov 11. The last one sold out fast.

We’ll build APIs with AI as a creative partner — using small, focused “AI coaches” to turn stories into specs, docs, and prototypes.
