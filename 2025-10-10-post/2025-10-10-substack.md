# AI-Driven API Design: Building with AI as Your Coach

AI is the new collaborator. 

My O’Reilly Live Course [AI-Driven API Design](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/ai-driven-api-design/0642572169893/) is back again on November 11th, 2025.

The last few times we ran this course, it filled up quickly (the most recent one sold out). And every session has reinforced the same truth: people aren’t looking for more automation, they’re looking for *better collaboration*.

During the three-hour course, you’ll work directly with the same LLM-driven "AI coaches" I use when I am designing APIs. These coaches are small, focused assistants that help you capture early requirements, generate API Story documents, ALPS meta descriptions, OpenAPI documents, mock servcices, tests, docs, and security profiles. All with the aid of conversational partners that help you think, revise, and refine your own ideas.

By the end of the session, you’ll walk away with both skills and tools along with the know-how to design APIs in the age of AI, and your own working AI coaches to keep experimenting with after the course.

**Takeaway**
This session is all about learning how AI tooling can amplify the designer’s reach. AI can draft the scaffolding, but the architecture still belongs to you.

If that sounds like your kind of partnership, join me live at O’Reilly:
